# Moonshot
Lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASAâ€™s Apollo space program.

#### What I learned
- Layout prioity expands or shrinks
  - Default: 0
  - 1 - expands
- Generics <T>
  - It helped with returning a generic type of array of either astronauts or missions
- GeometryReader helps with expanding to full width
- Spacer(minLength: 25) allows to indicate how many points we want our spacing to be. This allows to create vertical or horizontal spacing.
- Resizable modifier on image: simply allows to give it some constraints
- .buttonStyle(PlainButtonStyle()) - very useful in removing the color blue text in a button
- Codable
